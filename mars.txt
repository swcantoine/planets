I like mars it's a red planet. And martians are cool guys
I'm thinking of going to Mars, maybe some students would like to go too ?
What do you think it about it ?
It's kind of cold and borring there isn't ?
Venus looks cool too why not going there instead ? see venus.txt

Mathilde commented : 
I don't agree with you. 
I think we should cancel the project.
